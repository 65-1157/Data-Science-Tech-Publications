## 🏆 Selected Publications (2023–2025)

### 1. 🧠 Hybrid AI: Forecasting with Artificial Intelligence (2025)
**Title:** *Artificial Intelligence in Data Science: Evaluating Forecasting Models for Solar Energy in the Amazon Basin*
**Published in:** IEEE Access.

> **The Challenge:** Predicting solar irradiance in the Amazon is difficult due to high cloud variability and "noise" in the data.
> **My Solution:** I developed a novel framework evaluating forecasting models to address data scarcity and variability in the Amazon region.
> **Impact:** This work supports the energy transition by enabling more reliable integration of solar power into the grid.

### 2. 📉 Deep Learning Comparison: LSTM vs. GRU vs. MLP (2024)
**Title:** *Neural Networks Forecast Models Comparison for the Solar Energy Generation in Amazon Basin*
**Published in:** IEEE Access.

> **The Scope:** A massive comparative study covering **12 cities** in the Amazon (including Manaus and Labrea) over a **10-year period** (2013-2023).
> **The Analysis:** I benchmarked three Neural Network architectures: **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**, and **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**.
> **Key Results:** The **LSTM-GRU** models proved most efficient, achieving the lowest error (MAPE **19.2%**) in the city of Labrea.

* **Tech Stack:** Neural Networks (LSTM/GRU), Python, Time Series Forecasting.

### 3. 🛰️ Applied Data Science: Satellite Data & Ensembles (2023)
**Title:** *Application of data science in the prediction of solar energy for the Amazon basin: a study case*
**Published in:** Oxford Clean Energy.

> **The Innovation:** Addressed the lack of ground stations in the Amazon by engineering a pipeline that processes **NASA Satellite Data** (2013–2022).
> **The Algo:** Compared Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models against **Decision-Tree Ensembles** (Adaptive Boosting & Light Gradient Boosting).
> **Key Results:** Proved that Decision Tree Ensembles could achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as low as **0.20 kW.h/m²**.

* **Tech Stack:** Python, NASA POWER API, Scikit-Learn (AdaBoost/LightGBM).
